[h1]Prevent Family Wandering[/h1]
Tired of your family members or coutiers leaving your court to pursue a career in hairdressing?

You can now prevent that with this mod.

This mod implements a 'Right Click' menu that will allow you to prevent them from leaving the court. 
Or should you wish - allow them to leave the court as they please.
